*Tree* 
- A data structure in which data is represented in hierarchical form that makes it easy to navigate and search.

*Binary Trees*
A tree who has following criteria;
- It has exactly 1 root node (node having no parent node).
- It has at most 2 child nodes (child nodes could be 0,1 ,2).
- There is only one unique path from root to every node.

*Examples*

- A -> B -> C -> A : Not a binary tree as none of the nodes has no parents (no root node here, cycle).
- A : A single node is a binary tree as it qualifies for all the criteria.
- An empty tree is also a binary tree (A special case).
